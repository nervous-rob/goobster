# System Architecture

## Overview
Goobster is a Discord bot built using Discord.js that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4o model and Azure SQL Database. The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Components

### 1. Bot Framework (index.js)
- Initializes the Discord client
- Loads command modules dynamically
- Handles event management
- Manages command registration and execution

### 2. Command Handler (deploy-commands.js)
- Registers slash commands with Discord API
- Dynamically loads commands from the commands directory
- Validates command structure
- Manages command deployment to specific guilds

### 3. Database Connection (azureDb.js)
- Manages Azure SQL Database connections
- Provides connection pooling
- Handles database query execution
- Implements error handling for database operations

### 4. Command Structure
```
commands/
├── chat/           # Conversation and AI interaction commands
└── utility/        # System and user management commands
```

## Data Flow

1. **Command Initialization**
   - Bot starts up
   - Commands are loaded and registered
   - Database connection is established

2. **Command Execution**
   - User issues a slash command
   - Command is validated
   - Appropriate handler is called
   - Response is generated and sent

3. **AI Integration**
   - Messages are processed
   - OpenAI API is called
   - Responses are formatted
   - Results are stored in database

## Security Measures

- Token-based authentication for Discord
- Secure database connection handling
- Environment variable management
- API key protection

## Error Handling

- Graceful error recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging of system errors
- Database transaction management

## Scalability Considerations

- Connection pooling for database
- Asynchronous operation handling
- Resource cleanup
- Rate limiting implementation
